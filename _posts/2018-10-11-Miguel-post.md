This week I've been feeling so much better in this class as I got passed the problems I have been having and is excited for future projects we will be doing or beginning. 
So far from my memory and notes we have been working in pyret and also making a flag of our choosing, I chose to make the flag of my heritage, Colombia which is 3 colored rectangles facing horizontel with the colors in order, yellow, blue and red. A little bit of extra coding than expected but that is why I can ask for help when needed.
I been feeling seriously sick and tired this past week where I have to start taking medicine in class as well as home, I still get through the day it isn't that bad but I fear it may get worse
