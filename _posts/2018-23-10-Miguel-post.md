Today will be a more early reflection as github is having some technical issues so I will be doing this reflection today just in case so I won't have to deal with any problems later. Last week I was starting on pair programming and overlay. Today we did a pair work that invloved booleans, string, and number data. Seeing what will be returned back if we were to type something down specifically. It was a little confusing for a brief moment and it became clearer for my partner and I. We wrote down our theories before typing down the actual coding for most of our assumptions to be correct, slowly understanding each problem given as we look over our theories that were incorrect. Yesterday we started working on "shapes" on coding, not just the simple rectangle data but a chart that shows the name of said shape and how many angles/corners it has, and also to determine if it was "is-round" by using true or false on Pyret. Adding more shapes into the chart was breifly confusing until I noticed a pattern in the coding of making the other shapes which made it easier, then adding the is-round and putting true or false into the chart. I still am sick but feeling alot better than before but a little more sleepy and tired. Completely exhuasted from the P.A.C.E.R test but slowly getting that energy back thankfully. I'm probably going to make a part 2 of this week reflection as it was too early to be done but only if Github doesn't have technical issues at the time. Till next time I post a reflection, either this thursday or next week, goodnight
