![My Flag](/images/flag.png)

This week in AP CSP class we have been practicing overlay images with multiple different examples and our own imagination. To practice even further and test our skills and creativity with coding and overlay, we will be doing a flag project. The flag project despcription is said in the name, make a flag of our choosing using the colors and coding information we were given, each flag each person uses and size of the flag is up to our own choosing. Only challenges I have dealt with this week has to be able to work the overlay coding the way I want it for my flag, takes time to adjust to and will get it done in time. Another thing we have done in AP computer science class is pair programming which required two people, obviously, one person is the driver who uses the keyboard,mouse and computer while the navigator who can not touch the computer at all tells the driver what to type, I had no challenges with that specific part and niether did my partner as we got through multiple examples together.
