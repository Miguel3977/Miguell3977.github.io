This week on CSP class we were focusing on connections and contracts, things we noticed and thought when we saw specific coding, we were introduced to function definition, this was connect to last year we did similar coding but more advance in it with booleans and contracts. The difference now is that we also use test-case as well. We learned the function, "fun" which we used to double or multiply, and add/subtract given numbers. Learned how to repeat given data, which could have been made to produce number value, string or images, duplicating and repeating the range given. This week was a little harder than usual but that is fine, the biggest problem was how I wasn't motivated at all this week for a few amount of reasons but I'm still going to get the work I'm able to done when it's supposed to be done. Until next time whoever is reading this.
