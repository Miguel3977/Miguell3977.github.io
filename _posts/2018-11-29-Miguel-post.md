Hello whoever takes the time to read this, I am back with another blog post of my APC Computer Class. I will be looking at a question in a midterm that was recently taken by me and my peers, I will be looking at question 3 of the exam. I am interested in question 3 specifically not because it was the most correct or had more diffculty than others but by its proportion correct. Question 3 is an MS1 skill which tests the person on "using tools" as well as being a Novice difficulty it brought some confusion to people. 
The question asked, "What is the value of the 3rd arguement of the innmermost function in the expression below?" scale(2, circle(40, "solid", "blue")) with the options being, A) 2, B) 40, C)"solid", D) "Blue."
The correct answer was option D), "Blue" 
This question had a .500 proportion correct, easier version is 50.0% correct on this problem for being a novice difficulty and MS1 skillset so I assume people simply got confused at the word, innmermost function. That is all for today, bye bye.
