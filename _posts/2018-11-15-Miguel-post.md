So this reflection will be sort of strange as I will be combining the information and lessons learned from two weeks, not just one. I have been exploring more into data tables and I learned how to extract one specific data set from a specific row in a data chart. Learned how some data could be combined or even substituted together if coded correctly. This could be used for companies to find specific data much more easily or even used in a regular daily basis in life, for example help someone at looking at their finances and organizing them. This was more of gathering data and information that helps companies and possibly people which can make everyone's lives easier. I feel like I need a little more practice into making data charts in coding more than anything but I am still confident in my ability of understanding what it's proper uses are for and how to unlock that specific information. Well that was pretty much a summary which were short because of the day off of school between the two weeks, well till next time whoever reading this.
